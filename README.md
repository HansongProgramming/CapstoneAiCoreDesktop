# AiCore: Artificial Intelligence for Crimescene Observation and Reconstruction Enhancement.

AiCore is a cutting-edge AI-driven tool designed for bloodstain pattern analysis to automate calculations, crime scene reconstruction, and report generation. It leverages advanced 3D plotting, simulation, and computer vision technologies to assist forensic investigators in reconstructing crime scenes efficiently.

---

## Features

- **3D Bloodstain Pattern Visualization:**
  - Utilizes `PyVista` for detailed 3D plotting of bloodstain patterns.
    
- **Spatter Calculation:**
  - Employs Meta's `Segment Anything` model to identify and calculate blood spatter patterns with precision.

- **Advanced AI Integration:**
  - Built on `OpenCV`, `PyTorch`, and `NumPy` for image processing and deep learning-based pattern recognition.

- **Data Visualization:**
  - Includes `Matplotlib` for clear, customizable 2D visualizations.

- **Automated Report Generation:**
  - Creates detailed forensic reports with analysis summaries, visualizations, and key findings.
